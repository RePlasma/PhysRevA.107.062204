Abstract: _For the three-wave interaction, the lowest-order nonlinear interaction in plasma dynamics, we describe how the quantum system, which is time-independent, nonchaotic, finite-dimensional, and Hermitian, can give rise to a linear instability corresponding to that in the classical system. We show that the instability is realized in the quantum regime as a cascade of the wave function in the space of occupation number states, and the unstable quantum system has a richer spectrum and a much longer recurrence time than the stable quantum system. The conditions for instability of the quantum three-wave interaction are described._
